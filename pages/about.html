		<p>I see myself as a jack-of-all-trades. I've studied how to write, code, and work with people. Things that might seem on the surface to be different fields of study, but all come back to a conceptualization of architecture and repeated patterns. In short, there are efficient ways to create something that can achieve any goal, whether that be good software, a market definer, or first to the market.</p>
		<p>But, to understand that the concept is a possbility is seperate from the ability to understand <i>why</i> things should be assembled in specific ways. I strive to understand and demonstrate the ways behind the "why" of the problems at hand. This is key in developing modular and efficient systems in written works, computer code, and in the organization of people. All key elements in both corporate productivity and in the fostering the continued growth of any good project; open or otherwise.</p>
		<p>As I've been quoted (in jest) many a time, "to put a long story short:" to produce creations of quality, you must understand all its facets. To achieve that understanding, you must be willing to first learn each facet.</p>
		<p>And that, is how I guide the projects I work on forwards.</p>
